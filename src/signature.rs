/// - Instantiating a signature scheme generates a new key pair.
///   Concrete instantiations have to provide their own way of instantiating
///   themselves.
/// - The public key is exposed via `public_key()`
/// - Messages can be signed using `sign()`
/// - Signatures can be verified using `verify()`

    /// Verifies a signature.
    /// Note that this function does not require need `self`, hence does not need
    /// an instance of the signature scheme.
    /// This is because an instance of a signature scheme contains the signing key
    /// which is typically not available for the verifier.
